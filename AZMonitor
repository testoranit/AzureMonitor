Diagnostic settings under ur azure vm:- enable guest level monitoring additional capabilities.
it requires python 2 and a SA in same region of ur vm.

/subscriptions/5b8ab9e9-05ae-4317-80d9-873b9c409693/resourceGroups/tomcat-iaas-12-2020/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/tomcat-vm

then u need some detination to send the above data from diagnostic setting.
create a LAW

then create a DCR to send data to the above workspace.
(go to VM-->Insights--Monitor configuration-->create new rule to send it to LAW)

once done go to vm-->logs or this LAW and query heartbeat u would see the data being send by AMA to this new workspace.

then Enable DCR and DCE
